"__subclasses__"
class.__subclasses__()

   Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate
   subclasses.  This method returns a list of all those references
   still alive. Example:

      >>> int.__subclasses__()
      [<class 'bool'>]

   The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several
   object types, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported
   by the "dir()" built-in function.
