"center"
str.center(width[, fillchar])

   Return centered in a string of length *width*. Padding is done
   using the specified *fillchar* (default is an ASCII space). The
   original string is returned if *width* is less than or equal to
   "len(s)".

bytes.center(width[, fillbyte]), bytearray.center(width[, fillbyte])

   Return a copy of the object centered in a sequence of length
   *width*. Padding is done using the specified *fillbyte* (default is
   an ASCII space). For "bytes" objects, the original sequence is
   returned if *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

   Note: The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in
     place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were
     made.
