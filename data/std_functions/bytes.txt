"class bytes"
class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])

   Return a new "bytes" object, which is an immutable sequence of
   integers in the range "0 <= x < 256".  "bytes" is an immutable
   version of "bytearray" -- it has the same non-mutating methods and
   the same indexing and slicing behavior.

   Accordingly, constructor arguments are interpreted as for
   "bytearray()".

   Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see String and
   Bytes literals.

   See also Binary Sequence Types --- bytes, bytearray, memoryview,
   Bytes Objects, and Bytes and Bytearray Operations.
