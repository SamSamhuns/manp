"__qualname__"
\033[32;1mdefinition.__qualname__\033[0m   The *qualified name* of the class, function, method, descriptor, or
   generator instance.

   New in version 3.3.

   The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several
   object types, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported
   by the "dir()" built-in function.
