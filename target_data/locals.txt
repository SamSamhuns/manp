"locals"
locals()
   Update and return a dictionary representing the current local
   symbol table. Free variables are returned by "locals()" when it is
   called in function blocks, but not in class blocks. Note that at
   the module level, "locals()" and "globals()" are the same
   dictionary.

   Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified;
     changes may not affect the values of local and free variables
     used by the interpreter.
