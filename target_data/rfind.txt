"rfind"
\033[32;1mstr.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])\033[0m
   Return the highest index in the string where substring *sub* is
   found, such that *sub* is contained within "s[start:end]".
   Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as in slice
   notation.  Return "-1" on failure.

\033[32;1mbytes.rfind(sub[, start[, end]]), bytearray.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])\033[0m   Return the highest index in the sequence where the subsequence
   *sub* is found, such that *sub* is contained within "s[start:end]".
   Optional arguments *start* and *end* are interpreted as in slice
   notation. Return "-1" on failure.

   The subsequence to search for may be any *bytes-like object* or an
   integer in the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to
   255 as the subsequence.
