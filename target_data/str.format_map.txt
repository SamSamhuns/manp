"str.format_map"
str.format_map(mapping)
   Similar to "str.format(**mapping)", except that "mapping" is used
   directly and not copied to a "dict".  This is useful if for example
   "mapping" is a dict subclass:

   >>> class Default(dict):
   ...     def __missing__(self, key):
   ...         return key
   ...
   >>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))
   'Guido was born in country'

   New in version 3.2.
