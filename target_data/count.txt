"count"
\033[32;1mstr.count(sub[, start[, end]])\033[0m   Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring *sub*
   in the range [*start*, *end*].  Optional arguments *start* and
   *end* are interpreted as in slice notation.

\033[32;1mbytes.count(sub[, start[, end]]), bytearray.count(sub[, start[, end]])\033[0m
   Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence
   *sub* in the range [*start*, *end*].  Optional arguments *start*
   and *end* are interpreted as in slice notation.

   The subsequence to search for may be any *bytes-like object* or an
   integer in the range 0 to 255.

   Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to
   255 as the subsequence.
