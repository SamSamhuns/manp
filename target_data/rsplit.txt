"rsplit"
\033[32;1mstr.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)\033[0m
   Return a list of the words in the string, using *sep* as the
   delimiter string. If *maxsplit* is given, at most *maxsplit* splits
   are done, the *rightmost* ones.  If *sep* is not specified or
   "None", any whitespace string is a separator.  Except for splitting
   from the right, "rsplit()" behaves like "split()" which is
   described in detail below.

\033[32;1mbytes.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1), bytearray.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)\033[0m
   Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using
   *sep* as the delimiter string. If *maxsplit* is given, at most
   *maxsplit* splits are done, the *rightmost* ones.  If *sep* is not
   specified or "None", any subsequence consisting solely of ASCII
   whitespace is a separator. Except for splitting from the right,
   "rsplit()" behaves like "split()" which is described in detail
   below.
