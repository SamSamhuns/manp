"hasattr"
\033[32;1mhasattr(object, name)\033[0m   The arguments are an object and a string.  The result is "True" if
   the string is the name of one of the object's attributes, "False"
   if not. (This is implemented by calling "getattr(object, name)" and
   seeing whether it raises an "AttributeError" or not.)
