"getattr"
\033[32;1mgetattr(object, name[, default])\033[0m   Return the value of the named attribute of *object*.  *name* must
   be a string. If the string is the name of one of the object's
   attributes, the result is the value of that attribute.  For
   example, "getattr(x, 'foobar')" is equivalent to "x.foobar".  If
   the named attribute does not exist, *default* is returned if
   provided, otherwise "AttributeError" is raised.
