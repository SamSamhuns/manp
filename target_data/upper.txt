"upper"
str.upper()
   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4]
   converted to uppercase.  Note that "s.upper().isupper()" might be
   "False" if "s" contains uncased characters or if the Unicode
   category of the resulting character(s) is not "Lu" (Letter,
   uppercase), but e.g. "Lt" (Letter, titlecase).

   The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

bytes.upper(), bytearray.upper()

   Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII
   characters converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart.

   For example:

      >>> b'Hello World'.upper()
      b'HELLO WORLD'

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
   "b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are
   those byte values in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   Note: The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in
     place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were
     made.
