"map"
\033[32;1mmap(function, iterable, ...)\033[0m
   Return an iterator that applies *function* to every item of
   *iterable*, yielding the results.  If additional *iterable*
   arguments are passed, *function* must take that many arguments and
   is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel.  With
   multiple iterables, the iterator stops when the shortest iterable
   is exhausted.  For cases where the function inputs are already
   arranged into argument tuples, see "itertools.starmap()".
