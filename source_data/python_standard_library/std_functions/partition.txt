"partition"
\033[32;1mstr.partition(sep)\033[0m
   Split the string at the first occurrence of *sep*, and return a
   3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator
   itself, and the part after the separator.  If the separator is not
   found, return a 3-tuple containing the string itself, followed by
   two empty strings.

\033[32;1mbytes.partition(sep), bytearray.partition(sep)\033[0m   Split the sequence at the first occurrence of *sep*, and return a
   3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator
   itself or its bytearray copy, and the part after the separator. If
   the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing a copy of
   the original sequence, followed by two empty bytes or bytearray
   objects.

   The separator to search for may be any *bytes-like object*.
