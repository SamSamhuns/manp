"casefold"
\033[32;1mstr.casefold()\033[0m   Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be
   used for caseless matching.

   Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because
   it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For
   example, the German lowercase letter "'ß'" is equivalent to ""ss"".
   Since it is already lowercase, "lower()" would do nothing to "'ß'";
   "casefold()" converts it to ""ss"".

   The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

   New in version 3.3.
