"zfill"
str.zfill(width)

   Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII "'0'" digits to
   make a string of length *width*. A leading sign prefix
   ("'+'"/"'-'") is handled by inserting the padding *after* the sign
   character rather than before. The original string is returned if
   *width* is less than or equal to "len(s)".

   For example:

      >>> "42".zfill(5)
      '00042'
      >>> "-42".zfill(5)
      '-0042'


bytes.zfill(width), bytearray.zfill(width)
   Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII "b'0'" digits
   to make a sequence of length *width*. A leading sign prefix
   ("b'+'"/ "b'-'") is handled by inserting the padding *after* the
   sign character rather than before. For "bytes" objects, the
   original sequence is returned if *width* is less than or equal to
   "len(seq)".

   For example:

      >>> b"42".zfill(5)
      b'00042'
      >>> b"-42".zfill(5)
      b'-0042'

   Note: The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in
     place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were
     made.
