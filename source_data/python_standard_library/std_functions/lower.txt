"lower"
str.lower()
   Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4]
   converted to lowercase.

   The lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the
   Unicode Standard.

bytes.lower(), bytearray.lower()

   Return a copy of the sequence with all the uppercase ASCII
   characters converted to their corresponding lowercase counterpart.

   For example:

      >>> b'Hello World'.lower()
      b'hello world'

   Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
   "b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'". Uppercase ASCII characters are
   those byte values in the sequence "b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   Note: The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in
     place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were
     made.
