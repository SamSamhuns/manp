"iterator.__next__"
iterator.__next__()
    Return the next item from the container.  If there are no further
    items, raise the "StopIteration" exception.  This method
    corresponds to the "tp_iternext" slot of the type structure for
    Python objects in the Python/C API.

    Python defines several iterator objects to support iteration over
    general and specific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more
    specialized forms.  The specific types are not important beyond their
    implementation of the iterator protocol.

    Once an iterator's "__next__()" method raises "StopIteration", it must
    continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not
    obey this property are deemed broken.
