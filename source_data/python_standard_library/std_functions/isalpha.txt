str.isalpha()

   Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and
   there is at least one character, false otherwise.  Alphabetic
   characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character
   database as "Letter", i.e., those with general category property
   being one of "Lm", "Lt", "Lu", "Ll", or "Lo".  Note that this is
   different from the "Alphabetic" property defined in the Unicode
   Standard.

bytes.isalpha(), bytearray.isalpha()
   Return true if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetic ASCII
   characters and the sequence is not empty, false otherwise.
   Alphabetic ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
   "b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'".

   For example:

      >>> b'ABCabc'.isalpha()
      True
      >>> b'ABCabc1'.isalpha()
      False
