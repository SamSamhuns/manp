"vars"
\033[32;1mvars([object])\033[0m
   Return the "__dict__" attribute for a module, class, instance, or
   any other object with a "__dict__" attribute.

   Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable "__dict__"
   attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on
   their "__dict__" attributes (for example, classes use a
   "types.MappingProxyType" to prevent direct dictionary updates).

   Without an argument, "vars()" acts like "locals()".  Note, the
   locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to the
   locals dictionary are ignored.
