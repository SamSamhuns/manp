"float.hex"
float.hex()
   "float.hex()" is an instance method

   Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal
   string.  For finite floating-point numbers, this representation
   will always include a leading "0x" and a trailing "p" and exponent.

   Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings.  Since
   Python's floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a
   float to or from a *decimal* string usually involves a small rounding
   error.  In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation
   and specification of floating-point numbers.  This can be useful when
   debugging, and in numerical work.
