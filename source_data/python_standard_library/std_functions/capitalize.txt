"capitalize"
\033[32;1mstr.capitalize()\033[0m
   Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized
   and the rest lowercased.

\033[32;1mbytes.capitalize(), bytearray.capitalize()\033[0m
   Return a copy of the sequence with each byte interpreted as an
   ASCII character, and the first byte capitalized and the rest
   lowercased. Non-ASCII byte values are passed through unchanged.

   Note: The bytearray version of this method does *not* operate in
     place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were
     made.
