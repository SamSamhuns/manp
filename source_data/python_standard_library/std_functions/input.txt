"input"
\033[32;1minput([prompt])\033[0m
   If the *prompt* argument is present, it is written to standard
   output without a trailing newline.  The function then reads a line
   from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline),
   and returns that.  When EOF is read, "EOFError" is raised.
   Example:

      >>> s = input('--> ')
      --> Monty Python's Flying Circus
      >>> s
      "Monty Python's Flying Circus"

   If the "readline" module was loaded, then "input()" will use it to
   provide elaborate line editing and history features.
