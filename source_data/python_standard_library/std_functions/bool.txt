"bool"
\033[32;1mclass bool([x])\033[0m
   Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of "True" or "False".  *x* is
   converted using the standard truth testing procedure.  If *x* is
   false or omitted, this returns "False"; otherwise it returns
   "True".  The "bool" class is a subclass of "int" (see Numeric Types
   --- int, float, complex). It cannot be subclassed further.  Its
   only instances are "False" and "True" (see Boolean Values).

   Changed in version 3.7: *x* is now a positional-only parameter.
