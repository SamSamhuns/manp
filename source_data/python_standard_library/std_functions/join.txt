"join"
str.join(iterable)
   Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in
   *iterable*. A "TypeError" will be raised if there are any non-
   string values in *iterable*, including "bytes" objects.  The
   separator between elements is the string providing this method.

bytes.join(iterable), bytearray.join(iterable)
   Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of
   the binary data sequences in *iterable*.  A "TypeError" will be
   raised if there are any values in *iterable* that are not *bytes-
   like objects*, including "str" objects.  The separator between
   elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing
   this method.
