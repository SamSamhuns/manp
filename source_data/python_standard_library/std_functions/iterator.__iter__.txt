"iterator.__iter__"
iterator.__iter__()

   Return the iterator object itself.  This is required to allow both
   containers and iterators to be used with the "for" and "in"
   statements. This method corresponds to the "tp_iter" slot of the
   type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.
